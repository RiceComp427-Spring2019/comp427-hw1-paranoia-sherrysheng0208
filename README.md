## Problem 1
- Scenario: (b) As head of the TSA, you set the rules for screening passengers at airport checkpoints
- Assumptions:
- To improve efficiency, passengers are checked continuously, which means that the following passenger can start screening even though the previous passenger has not finished checking.
- Passengers are required to take off their coats and shoes before screening.
- Passengers are required to take out their laptops and mobile phones from their bags and put them into a box.
- Assets:
- Passengers’ personal information: name, passport number, birthday, nationality, credit card number and CVV.
- Flight information: departure time, arrival time, flight number, destination.
- Passengers’ personal belongings: things in the bags and suitcases, wallets, passport
- Threats:
- Thieves who get passengers’ personal information may log in to passengers’ bank account. Thieves can also get to know the information of passengers’ families and blackmail their families.
- If a passenger is still screening but his luggage has finished screening, the luggage will be left unattended. Criminals can put some drugs into his bags to smuggle. Besides, because passengers need to take off their coats and take out their electronic devices, it is easy for thieves to steal them.
- TSA agents may be a little handsy when screening.
- If thieves know passengers’ destinations, they can stalk them.
- Countermeasures:
- TSA should start to screen the next passenger when the previous one finishes checking. As a result, every passenger has time to put their stuff in order and it will be harder for thieves to steal their personal information.
- Airport checkpoint can build small rooms or compartments for each passenger to screen and protect everyone’s privacy.

## Problem 2
- Scenario: (d) You are grading homework submission for a class of 200+ students.
- Assumptions:
- Students submit their homework in both electronic document and paper document.
- Assets:
- Content and answers of each student's homework.
- Each student’ grades.
- Threats:
- Thieves may steal students’ homework and declare that's their work. It may cause high similarity and plagiarism for students, which will harm students’ academic reputation. 
- Some students may want to increase their grades. In this highly competitive society, some students may even want to decrease others’ grades. Because the class is large, professor cannot remember every student’s grades. If the grades of two people are switched, it is hard to notice.
- Countermeasures:
- For electronic document: Change both grades file and students’ homework to "read only" and no one can modify them unless there is a correct password entered. 
- For paper document: keep a second file to store those grades and only the grade is correct when two grades are the same.

## Problem 3
- Scenario: People are waiting for buses at bus station.
- Assumptions:
- There are many people waiting at the bus station. 
- Most of people put their wallets in their bags and mobile phones in their pockets.
- Some people are talking on the phones or texting.
- Assets:
- Passengers’ personal belongings: bags, mobile phones, wallets.
- Threats:
- Personal information may be eavesdropped during a phone call. Criminals may know where you live, where you are going to or what your job is.
- Thieves may steal passengers’ mobile phones, credit cards or wallets without being noticed while waiting. If people are focus on their phone calls or texts, it is easy for thieves to steal things in the pockets.
- Criminals may stalk passengers to their destinations especially during the night. They follow passengers on the bus and commit a crime when there is nobody around.
- Countermeasures:
- Passengers should pay more attention to their environment and notice whether there is any suspicious person following them. Once they find something suspicious, they should call the police or ask for other passengers’ help immediately.
- Passengers may pack their bags on their chest instead of at the back, so that it will become more difficult for thieves to steal their belongings.
- Passengers should remember to zip up their bags all the time in case something in the bags fall out of it.
- Passengers should hold their mobile phone on the hands. Because mobile phone is small, it is difficult to notice if someone steals it.
- Passengers should try to avoid leaking out their personal information on the calls or try to speak in a low voice.
